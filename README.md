# IP Calc
The IP Calculator allows users to input an IP address and choose a subnet mask (CIDR) along with the desired number of subnets. It then calculates and displays details for each subnet, including the network address, broadcast address, the first and last host addresses, subnet mask, and wildcard mask. This tool is particularly useful for managing and configuring local networks and their subnets, assisting users in optimizing network resource allocation.
